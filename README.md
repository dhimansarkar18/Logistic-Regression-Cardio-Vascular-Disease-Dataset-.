# Background

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) kills more people than cancer globally. A dataset of real heart patients collected from a 15 year heart study cohort is made available for this assignment. The dataset has 16 patient features. Note that none of the features include any Blood Test information.

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github: 
("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/Logistic-Regression-Cardio-Vascular-Disease-Dataset-./blob/main/cvd_data.csv")

# Code

Python Notebook: 
("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/Logistic-Regression-Cardio-Vascular-Disease-Dataset-./blob/main/Logistic_Regression_(Cardio_Vascular_Disease_Dataset).ipynb")

# Instructions on How to Launch
 - I. Open the python notebook on google colab. 
 - II. Mount the Google Drive: drive.mount("/content/drive") 
 - III. Link the working directories: "/content/drive/MyDrive/MSBA_Colab_2020/ML_Algorithms/CA05/Data/cvd_data.csv"
 - IV. Run the Code 
 - V. Generating the Accuracy and the ROC AUC Score for the best model
